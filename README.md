<H1>Empirical Free Energy Force Field for AutoDock 4</H1>

AutoDock 4 estimates free energy of binding for a receptor-ligand complex using a semi-empirical free energy force field. This force field has been calibrated against a dataset composed of crystallographic structures for which ligand-binding affinity data is known (Morris et al., 2009). The present Python code calculates the van der Waals, intermolecular hydrogen bond, electrostatic interaction, and desolvation potentials based on the atomic coordinates of the ligand and the receptor. This program reads atomic coordinates in the PDBQT format and prints the potential energy terms. It is not calibrated for a specific dataset, so it might be used to develop targeted-scoring functions, which may be used to explore the scoring function space (Heck et al. 2017). The zipped folder has the atomic coordinates for both, receptor (receptor.pdbqt) and ligand (lig.pdbqt) structures. I intend to use this code to develop a new tool in the SAnDReS program (Xavier et al., 2016)( https://github.com/azevedolab/sandres) to generate targeted-scoring functions.

As a result of my research, I published over 200 scientific works about protein structures, computer models of complex systems, and simulations of protein systems.

Due to the impact of my work, I have been ranked among the most influential researchers in the world (Fields: Biophysics, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, and Biomedical Research) according to a database created by <a href = "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33064726/" title = "Ioannidis JPA, Boyack KW, Baas J.

Not bad for a poor guy who was a shoe seller at a store in São Paulo and had the opportunity to study at the University of São Paulo with a scholarship for food and housing. I was 23 when I initiated my undergraduate studies and was the first in my family to have access to higher education.

Regarding scientific impact (<a href = "https://www.sciencenews.org/article/rating-researchers" title = "Rating Researchers">Peterson, 2005</a>), Hirsch said that for a physicist, an h-index of 45 or higher could mean membership in the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. So far, there have been no invitations. No hard feelings because I am in good company. <a href = "https://theconversation.com/carl-sagans-scientific-legacy-extends-far-beyond-cosmos-240885" title = "Carl Sagan’s scientific legacy extends far beyond ‘Cosmos’">Carl Sagan</a> was never allowed into the National Academy of Sciences.

“Social media gives the right to speak to legions of imbeciles who previously only spoke at the bar after a glass of wine, without damaging the community. They were immediately silenced, but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It’s the invasion of imbeciles.”
